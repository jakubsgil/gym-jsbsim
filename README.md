# Gym-Jsbsim

Gym-JSBSim provides reinforcement learning environments for the control of fixed-wing aircraft using the JSBSim flight dynamics model. Gym-JSBSim requires a Unix-like OS and Python 3.6.

The package's environments implement the OpenAI Gym interface allowing environments to be created and interacted with in the usual way, e.g.:

```
import gym
import gym_jsbsim

env = gym.make(ENV_ID)
env.reset()
state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

Gym-JSBSim optionally provides 3D visualisation of controlled aircraft using the FlightGear simulator.

## Dependencies

* [JSBSim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim) flight dynamics model, including the C++ and Python libraries
* FlightGear simulator (optional for visualisation)
* gym, numpy, matplotlib

## Installation
Firstly, follow the instructions on the [JSBSim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim) repository to install JSBSim and its libraries.

Confirm that JSBSim is installed from the terminal:

```
$ JSBSim --version
JSBSim Version: 1.0.0 Jul 16 2018 09:14:35
```

and confirm that its Python library is correctly installed from a Python interpreter or IDE:

```
import jsbsim
```

Gym-JSBSim is pip installable using its GitHub:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Gor-Ren/gym-jsbsim
```

## Environments

Gym-JSBSim implements two tasks for controlling the altitude and heading of aircraft:

* **HeadingControl**: aircraft must fly in a straight line, maintaining its initial altitude and direction of travel (heading)
* **TurnHeadingControl**: aircraft must turn to face a random target heading while maintaining their initial altitude

The environment can be configured to use one of three aircraft:

* **Cessna172P** light aircraft
* **F15** fighter jet
* **A320** airliner



Environment ID strings are constructed as follows:
```
f'JSBSim-{task}-{aircraft}-SHAPING_STANDARD-NoFG-v0'
```

For example, to fly a Cessna on the TurnHeadingControl task,

```
env = gym.make('JSBSim-TurnHeadingControl-Cessna172P-SHAPING.STANDARD-NoFG-v0')
```


## Visualisation

### 2D

A basic plot of agent actions and current state information can be using `human` render mode by calling `env.render(mode='human')`.


### 3D

3D visualisation requires installation of the FlightGear simulator. Confirm it is runnable from terminal with:

```
fgfs --version
```

Visualising with FlightGear requires the Gym to be created with a FlightGear-enabled environment ID by changing 'NoFG' -> 'FG'. For example,
```
env = gym.make('JSBSim-TurnHeadingControlTask-Cessna172P-Shaping.STANDARD-NoFG-v0')
```
Then, the first call to `env.render(mode='flightgear')` will launch FlightGear and begin visualisation. 

## State and Action Space

Gym-JSBSim's environments have a continuous state and action space. The state is a 17-tuple:

```
(name='position/h-sl-ft', description='altitude above mean sea level [ft]', min=-1400, max=85000)
(name='attitude/pitch-rad', description='pitch [rad]', min=-1.5707963267948966, max=1.5707963267948966)
(name='attitude/roll-rad', description='roll [rad]', min=-3.141592653589793, max=3.141592653589793)
(name='velocities/u-fps', description='body frame x-axis velocity [ft/s]', min=-2200, max=2200)
(name='velocities/v-fps', description='body frame y-axis velocity [ft/s]', min=-2200, max=2200)
(name='velocities/w-fps', description='body frame z-axis velocity [ft/s]', min=-2200, max=2200)
(name='velocities/p-rad_sec', description='roll rate [rad/s]', min=-6.283185307179586, max=6.283185307179586)
(name='velocities/q-rad_sec', description='pitch rate [rad/s]', min=-6.283185307179586, max=6.283185307179586)
(name='velocities/r-rad_sec', description='yaw rate [rad/s]', min=-6.283185307179586, max=6.283185307179586)
(name='fcs/left-aileron-pos-norm', description='left aileron position, normalised', min=-1, max=1)
(name='fcs/right-aileron-pos-norm', description='right aileron position, normalised', min=-1, max=1)
(name='fcs/elevator-pos-norm', description='elevator position, normalised', min=-1, max=1)
(name='fcs/rudder-pos-norm', description='rudder position, normalised', min=-1, max=1)
(name='error/altitude-error-ft', description='error to desired altitude [ft]', min=-1400, max=85000)
(name='aero/beta-deg', description='sideslip [deg]', min=-180, max=180)
(name='error/track-error-deg', description='error to desired track [deg]', min=-180, max=180)
(name='info/steps_left', description='steps remaining in episode', min=0, max=300)
 ```
 Actions are 3-tuples of floats in the range [-1,+1] describing commands to move the aircraft's control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, rudder):
 ```
 (name='fcs/aileron-cmd-norm', description='aileron commanded position, normalised', min=-1.0, max=1.0)
 (name='fcs/elevator-cmd-norm', description='elevator commanded position, normalised', min=-1.0, max=1.0)
 (name='fcs/rudder-cmd-norm', description='rudder commanded position, normalised', min=-1.0, max=1.0)
 ```

## Limitations / FYI

* Limitations in JSBSim restrict you to one JSBSim instance per process. Therefore parallelising Gym JSBSim environments requires you to use multiprocessing, rather than multithreading.
* Gym-JSBSim has some relatively sophisticated reward shaping capabilities. I embarked on reward shaping when my agents weren't learning... turns out I had simply turned off an undocumented but essential flag in my RL agent library's hyperparameters which basically turned off learning. In the end, my results showed that my principled and well-intentioned reward shaping efforts had no improvement over the "STANDARD" reward setting. Such is life :-)
* The FlightTask classes rely heavily on inheritance and overriding methods for correct behaviour... a "favour composition over inheritance" would have been better. But hey, it was documented.
* I had to add a voodoo pause to the FlightGear visualisation code, otherwise it could hang during start-up. It's probably pretty brittle as a result.
